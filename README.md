### Hi there 👋

I'm a software engineer from France 🇫🇷. But I define myself more as Global citizens 🌍

I'm currently working on Front-end team at Splitfire, I'm in love with React.

I'm a Open source contributor as a front-end developer [@webcompat](https://github.com/webcompat/) team [@Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org).

Father of two wonderful girls 👨‍👩‍👧‍👧‍

If I'm not coding or [tweeting](https://twitter.com/magsout), I'm likely watching a tv show / movie 🎥📺 or playing basketball 🏀
